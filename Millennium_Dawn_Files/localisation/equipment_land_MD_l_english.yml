 camouflage_desc:0 "Camouflaged Uniforms are a vital necessity of any modern army. In these days of war fought with ranged weapons, making it harder for our boys to be spotted in the field can make the difference between life and death."
 camouflage2:0 "MultiCam"
 camouflage2_desc:0 "MultiCam is a special kind of camouflage developed by the US Army in 2002. It allows a single pattern to effectively camouflage unites in a wide variety of conditions. Switching uniforms for MultiCam uniforms will allow our forces to sneak around the enemy more efficiently, and improve their ability in the field."

 camouflage3_desc:0 "‘Digital’ patterns designed to look pixelated help our boys remained camouflaged at a variety of distances. Modifying the MultiCam pattern to use the digital pattern should further improve its efficiency."
 camouflage4:0 "Improved Camouflage Patterns"
 camouflage4_desc:0 "Recent breakthroughs in the way the human eye processes information has given the military new ideas for designing camouflage patterns. Certain changes to the amount of pixelation of digital camouflage, and some changes in the shade of certain colors should give us an edge in battle."
 camouflage5:0 "Future Camouflage Patterns"
 camouflage5_desc:0 "New Smart Materials allow our uniforms to detect the amount of sunlight they are exposed to, and slightly change colors accordingly. This more dynamic camouflage should be of great use to our men."
 camouflage6:0 "Smart Camo"
 camouflage6_desc:0 "Camouflaged patterns are a thing of the past. Originally developed for our Spec Ops Teams, we have created a special uniform called ‘Smart Camo’, originally an all black armored suit, it will adopt the colored pattern of any object it is placed against. This should allow our men to become nearly undetectable in the battlefield until it is too late for the enemy to respond."
