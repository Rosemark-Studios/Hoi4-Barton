 PRC_military_reorganization_desc:0 "New tactics and technologies have changed the modern battlefield and the Chinese army must adapt to be ready for future conflict."
 PRC_anti_corruption:0 "Anti-Corruption Measures"
 PRC_anti_corruption_desc:0 “As much as our state media denies it, communist governments tend to be pretty corrupt. This is especially so in China, as the recent growth in the economy has allowed thousands of nameless ministers to illegally enrich themselves with profits that should be going to the Party. Of course, while we are going about arresting the men skimming of the top, we can make a big public campaign about it. The people will think more money will be spent on them now, and that should keep them happy.”
 PRC_industrial_safety:0 "Industrial Safety Laws"
 PRC_industrial_safety_desc:0 “What allowed us to become the modern workshop of the world was allowing our people to work in brutal conditions no western nation would accept, and all for virtually no pay. As much as the more benevolent men within the Party might want to change this, doing so would weaken China’s position as a rising superpower. Still, we can offer minor concessions and make sure people know all about what the government is doing to protect them. That should calm down any thoughts of protesting their conditions.”
 PRC_educational_development:0 "Education Development"
 PRC_educational_development_desc:0 “China is a very large nation, both in area and population. Because of this, our education system isn’t the best. Our schools tend to be underfunded and undermanned, cheating is rampant, and our constant demands for political indoctrination seem to be getting in the way of proper learning. If we wish to take the mantle of leading world power from the Americans, we need to begin to address these concerns to make our education system the finest in the world. Except for the political indoctrination. That stays.”
 PRC_communications_network:0 "Communications Networks"
 PRC_public_services:0 "Public Services"
 PRC_public_services_desc:0 “Our cities are massively inefficient. Traffic Jams may last days on end, trash tends to pile up, and pollution is high. Beginning some investments in improving public services in major cities should improve the efficiency of local governments, increasing the available resources for us in the Central Government to spend in other things.”
 PRC_research_initiatives:0 "Research Initiatives"
 PRC_research_initiatives_desc:0 “Frankly, it is insulting to the Chinese spirit that most modern science comes from the Western World. Our various reforms have begun improving the Chinese education system, but more needs to be done. We should set up a program with very large rewards, both monetary and otherwise, for Chinese researchers who make scientific breakthroughs. Our nation is massive, surely we have one Steven Hawking or two around somewhere to compete with the West.”
 PRC_diplomatic_initatives:0 "Diplomatic Initiatives"
 PRC_diplomatic_initatives_desc:0 “Our economic might, and ideological differences from the west, will allow us to gain many allies in nations that do not feel comfortable with the current world order.

 PRC_trade_deals:0 "International Trade Deals"
 PRC_trade_deals_desc:0 “The west might not like to acknowledge it, but most nations outside of Europe and North America only align with them for financial reasons.

 PRC_educational_exchanges:0 "Educational Exchanges"
 PRC_educational_exchanges_desc:0 “There is a whole lot of countries out there, and that means a whole lot of students. We should help our Universities do Educational Exchange Programs, to send our students abroad and welcom foreigners to our country. Not only will the students bring in new knowledge from the outside world, but the foreigners we welcome will spread good words about China back home.” 
 PRC_economic_liberalization:0 "Economic Liberalization"
 PRC_economic_liberalization_desc:0 “It seems that not many countries are happy with doing educational exchanges with China, or cooperating with Chinese companies, while the government maintains absolute control. Perhaps with should pass some reforms to loosen our control in the economy, to incentivize people more and give ourselves a better image overseas.”
 PRC_free_markets:0 "Free Markets"
 PRC_free_markets_desc:0 “Well, our recent economics reforms has pushed for new demands from our young private sector. Several would be businessmen, no doubt influenced by outside ideas, have presented the government with a brand new reformed system for our control of the economy. Basically, we will allow quasi free market economic actions to take place inside the country, but the government will retain total authority in any exchange involving a foreign party. Not only will this discredit foreign propaganda about our totalitarianism, it will increase the efficiency of our economy much more.”
 PRC_african_initiatives:0 "African Initiatives"
 PRC_african_initiatives_desc:0 “The nations of Africa have been impoverished for centuries. Not many nations really prospered by European or Asian standards, and their time as European Colonies, while certainly helpful for their modernization, didn’t help them develop too much. Its been decades since de-colonization, and many nations’ infrastructures are in disrepair, relying on old colonial roads and railways. If we begin organizing investment funds for several of these nations, we will have gained many new friends.”
 PRC_east_african_trade:0 "East African Trade"
 PRC_east_african_trade_desc:0 “Eastern Africa is often ignored by the west, and the nations of the region would be very grateful to have the option to trade with China directly. We should draft proposals for trade agreements with Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.”
 PRC_east_african_development:0 "East African Development"
 PRC_east_african_development_desc:0 “Our new African Partners are very grateful for our proposals, but they cynically still think this is little more than us taking advantage of their poor position. We should show them our goodwill by helping them develop. Let’s modernize their railways and manufacturing capabilities. We should send some industrial engineers to take core of this, have the Interior Ministry of Industry compile a list of candidates, and we will send them abroad.”

It will take time to coordinate what various levels of governments will be expected to do.”
 PRC_state_media_apparatus:0 "State Media Apparatus"
 PRC_state_media_apparatus_desc:0 “Beijing has controlled all media in China for a long time now. Even foreign media allowed to operate in China is heavily controlled by the government.

 PRC_harmonious_society:0 "Harmonious Society"
 PRC_harmonious_society_desc:0 “We can’t be gearing up to take on the world with pesky protestors causing internal problems. We already send most of our troublemakers to work camps across the country, but maybe we should expand that program. Build as many camps as needed until not a single protestor is on the streets. We need to begin planning where they will be built.”

Let’s get a couple of appropriate films ready for each potential enemy.”

 PRC_to_serve_the_people_desc:0 “The average person seems to have trouble believing that the People’s Liberation Army is here to protect and serve them above all else. Making some meaningless but symbolic programs for the PLA to do minor things for the average person will make people respect them more, increasing recruitment. Plus, there is a chance some soldiers might buy into it, giving them better conviction in combat, as they are the ‘last line of defense for the people of China against oppression’.”
 PRC_neo_maoist_doctrine:0 "Neo-Maoist Doctrine"
 PRC_neo_maoist_doctrine_desc:0 “Holding that ‘Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun’, Chairman Mao’s rhetoric seems like just what we need people to be thinking right now. They must understand that if China is to rise to its rightful place as the mightiest nation on earth, wars will have to be won. And if we expect that to happen, we are gonna have to expect some sacrifices and hardships from the people.”
 PRC_core_national_interests:0 "Core National Interests"

 PRC_xinjiang_crackdown:0 "Xinjiang Crackdown"
 PRC_xinjiang_crackdown_desc:0 “China’s Muslim Uighur minority has been causing trouble in Xinjiang. Religious extremism, and long distance from the central government have lead to some minor attacks on government property and talks of resistance. We cannot tolerate this. It will make nations overly concerned with human rights upset, but you can never please them anyway.”
 PRC_xinjiang_security_operations:0 "Xinjiang Security Operations"
 PRC_xinjiang_security_operations_desc:0 “Now that we have dealt with the most obvious threats, let’s set up operations to make sure this does not happen again. Wiretap everything, set up military patrols 24/7, have paid spies. Every citizen in the region must be watched by the government.”
 PRC_border_security:0 "Border Security"
 PRC_border_security_desc:0 “Part of the reason the Uighurs are such a threat to us, is because they identify more with their Central Asian neighbors than with the Chinese people. We need to do something about these countries, that give them such ludicrous ideas of rebellion. Our borders with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are awfully weak. Now, we could attempt to close down the border and increase security, but if we are gonna be sending the PLA over there anyway… we might want to just… renegotiate those borders. Peacefully. After we march on Bishkek and Dushanbe.”
 PRC_tibet_media_blackout:0 "Tibet Media Blackout"
 PRC_tibet_media_blackout_desc:0 “It seems like the Tibetan people aren’t very happy about being part of the People’s Republic. The government has some ideas on what to do in the short term, but there is not much we can do with all those pesky news crews everywhere. Let’s get those cameras off, and then we can talk. The West probably won’t like this, but hey, who is the rising superpower here?”
 PRC_demand_dalai_lama:0 "Demand Dalai Lama"
 PRC_demand_dalai_lama_desc:0 “The Dalai Lama is regarded as the true head of state of the super religious nation of Tibet. Of course, this is laughable, especially because of that funny typo. ‘Tibet’ is a funny way to spell ‘Western China’. We have been trying to alienate nations from respecting him, but his actions have increased the people of Tibet’s calls for independence from China. He currently resides in exile in India. We should try and apply pressure on India’s government to hand him over to Chinese authorities.” 
 PRC_southern_border_adjustment:0 "Southern Border Adjustment"
 PRC_southern_border_adjustment_desc:0 “Well, while we are on the subject of dealing with India, we do have that embarrassing territorial dispute with them. We need to resolve it in our favor, and fast. We cannot just wait for a solution potentially filled with compromises to be found diplomatically, we need to ready the PLA. We solve this through war.”
 PRC_one_china_concensus:0 "One China Consensus"
 PRC_one_china_concensus_desc:0 “Its difficult acting like a world power when you have a government-in-exile right next door. The Taiwanese Government, descended from the Kuomintang Government Chairman Mao overthrew in the revolution, is a thorn in our side. We need to more thoroughly enforce our demands that any government wishing to maintain diplomatic ties with us, break ties with Taiwan, and vice versa. Taiwan won’t like that, but in the end, it won’t matter.”
 PRC_demand_rightful_territory:0 "Demand Rightful Territory"
 PRC_demand_rightful_territory_desc:0 “We must make it clear to the Taiwanese that we do not intend to sit idly by forever and let them be de facto independent. We WILL claim their island, and we WILL get it in the end. Still, there is no need to be so blunt. For now, we can negotiate a reasonable agreement, where they agree to de facto recognize us as the Chinese government, and we agree to not meddle in their internal affairs.” 
 PRC_final_ultimatum:0 "Final Ultimatum"
 PRC_final_ultimatum_desc:0 “These political games with Taiwan were fun and all, but playtime is over.

 PRC_nine_dash_line:0 "Nine Dash Line"
 PRC_nine_dash_line_desc:0 “The Nine Dash Line refers to our various claims across the South China Sea. Sadly, the rest of the world doesn’t seem to respect them, because they think our ancient maps showing Chinese control of the regions are not sufficient for modern territorial claims. We must begin to make it clear to the world we will enforce our claims in the region by force, if necessary. The nations of the Pacific probably won’t like this very much, but that’s an issue for the Foreign Ministry.“
 PRC_xisha_claims:0 "Xisha Claims"
 PRC_xisha_claims_desc:0 "Xisha, also known as the Paracel Islands in the west, are a group of islands in the South China Sea. While we control them, the Vietnamese Government claims them for themselves under the name of Hoàng Sa.

 PRC_nansha_claims:0 "Nansha Claims"
 PRC_nansha_claims_desc:0 “The Nansha islands, or the Spratly Islands in the west, are another group of islands in the South China Sea. This time, its the Philippines that have an issue with our controlling our rightful territory. Thankfully, we don’t have much to fear from them, but we still should prepare some statements making it clear to the world that we intend to hold them at any cost.“
 PRC_vietnam_border_adjustment:0 "Vietnam Border Adjustment"
 PRC_vietnam_border_adjustment_desc:0 “The Vietnamese may also be our comrades in the Marxist Revolution, but they are very bad ones. First, they had the audacity to fight us in a war after they threatened our Cambodian allies. Then, they aligned themselves with Moscow over us, and now, long after the USSR is gone, they seem like they wish to align themselves with the west! We cannot tolerate this. Fabricate some incident in their border, we must take Vietnam. A true communist revolution means that there can not be two communist states anyway.“
 PRC_east_sea_territory:0 "East Sea Territory"
 PRC_east_sea_territory_desc:0 “We have some territories in the East China Sea that are sadly not flying the Five Star Red Flag.

 PRC_diaoyu_claim_desc:0 “The Diaoyu Islands, also known as the Senkaku Islands by their Japanese occupiers, are a set of islands in the East China Sea. They are rightfully Chinese territory, but the Japanese claim them to be part of the Ryukyu Islands, and the Taiwanese claim that, as the ‘true Chinese Government’, the islands actually belong to them. We cannot allow the Japanese, who so greatly hurt and humiliated the Chinese people in the Second World War, to hold even a single inch of Chinese Territory! Prepare a statement. Japanese Authorities will withdraw from the islands. Or else.“

 PRC_eastern_military_industry_desc:0 “Its nice to know the people of Qingdao can get ever so slightly cheaper TVs now, but let’s be honest, its time we put the new industry to good use. Let’s set up factories that will start pumping out tanks and other equipment for the People’s Liberation Army.”
